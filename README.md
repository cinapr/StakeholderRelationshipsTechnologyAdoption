# Exploring Stakeholder Relationships in Technology Adoption as Strategic Innovation : Narrative Literature Review

## Abstract
Strategic innovation is critical for business survival in the modern, dynamic, and competitive environment. However, the complex relationships among stakeholders and their influence on the strategic innovation process have not been thoroughly investigated. This study fills this gap by exploring external factors influencing stakeholder decisions, shaping technology adoption into a strategic innovation process that enhances business resilience. 

Using case studies, the research highlights how stakeholder decision interconnections contribute to resilience. It provides a model for stakeholder decisions in technology adoption and emphasizes the critical role of technology adoption in strategic innovation, enabling organizations to adapt to market dynamics and improve competitiveness. Success in technology adoption, the study concludes, depends on collaborative stakeholder decision-making that reinforces business resilience.
